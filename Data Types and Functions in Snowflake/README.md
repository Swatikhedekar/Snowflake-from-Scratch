Data Types and Functions in Snowflake
Snowglake more advance functinality. We start with VARIENT data type(semi-structured data). learning to parse top-level & nested data using dot-notation and brachet-notation, then master common table expressions(CTEs) by building and using CTEs.
Finaly creating PIVOT tables using PIVOT keyword to transform data into easy-to-digest format, ready for report and analysis.
